      <description>This version of the post is a reedition of the original. It dates from 2018-12-27.
No shortcut to learningWhen I started writing this post, I was fairly confident it would be quick. After all, I had all the materials I needed, a bunch of scripts I had spent months writing. It was supposed to be a matter of copy-and-paste. I was wrong. You see, once again, I underestimated the power of the monster in me who wants to get it right all the time.</description>

      <description>My first data science projectI first started to work on the list from the Malilink website during October 2017. I was stunned that I haven’t heard about it before (that goes to show that don’t read all my emails; I joined the platform few years earlier and I was on the mailing list). My first approach was to copy from the website and paste into an Excel spreadsheet (at that time, I hadn’t learned about the miracles of web scraping packages - I’m almost ashamed to admit it).</description>

      <description>Last year, I made a new friend. She (yes, it’s a “she”) introduced me to Kaggle. I had no idea what that was. She was amused, and I slightly embarrassed. I, who think of myself as a worldly man, modern, aware of what happening here and there (yes, I get sometimes caught up a delusion of grandeur in my head), had no clue what Kaggle was. She proposed that we train together to enter a competition.</description>
