      <description>I’m terrified as I write these words. Not because I’ve been summoned by Queen Cersei or because I’m fighting the White Walkers alongside Jon Snow. No. I wish I was, though.

But now, now that I know how much words matter, I tend to be cautious when talking or writing.</description>
