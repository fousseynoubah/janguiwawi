      <description>This a rewrite of an article originally titled “Security incidents in Mali: mapping the hotspots” and posted on 2018/06/08.
In this post, I keep exploring the data on security incidents in Mali from this Malilink webpage.

      <description>This an update of the original post. It dates from 2018-12-27.
No shortcut to learningWhen I started writing this post, I was fairly confident it would be quick. After all, I had all the materials I needed, a bunch of scripts I had spent months writing. It was supposed to be a matter of copy-and-paste. I was wrong. You see, once again, I underestimated the power of the monster in me who wants to get it right all the time.</description>
